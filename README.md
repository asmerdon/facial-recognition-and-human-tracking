This repository contains the code for two models: a facial recognition model, and a human-tracking model.

Facial recognition model: this model takes in a selfie, and a document (passport, ID, etc...) and returns a similarity score to detect whether a the faces in both images are the same. 

Human tracking model: this model takes video input and detects any humans in the video, outlines them, and blurs them (this last part was done for an artistic project, however the core tracking features work independantly).
