### Overview
This repository contains the code for two models: a **facial recognition model** and a **human tracking model**.

#### Facial Recognition Model
This model takes in a selfie and a document image (e.g. passport, ID card, etc.) and returns a similarity score to determine whether the faces in both images belong to the same person.

#### Human Tracking Model
This model takes video input, detects any humans in the footage, outlines them, and applies a blur effect. The blurring was added for an artistic project; however, the core tracking features function independently.
